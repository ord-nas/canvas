How to access webserver running in Ubuntu VM from host machine.

1) Make Ubuntu IP address static.

Followed instructions here: https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-configure-static-ip-address-on-ubuntu-18-10-cosmic-cuttlefish-linux

Also used these instructions to get current IP address, DNS, and default route (which I think is the same as the gateway that the Ubuntu options ask for): https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/17012/how-to-find-your-ip-address-in-ubuntu/

Settings used were:

Wired connection 1 > IPv4 Settings
Method: Manual
Address: 192.168.200.183
Netmask: 24
Gateway: 192.168.200.2
DNS Servers: 192.168.200.2

2) Start up webserver on Ubuntu (e.g. on port 8080).

3) Then just visit 192.168.200.183:8080.
