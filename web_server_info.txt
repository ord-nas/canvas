How to access webserver running in Ubuntu VM from host machine.

1A) Make Ubuntu IP address static.

Followed instructions here: https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-configure-static-ip-address-on-ubuntu-18-10-cosmic-cuttlefish-linux

Also used these instructions to get current IP address, DNS, and default route (which I think is the same as the gateway that the Ubuntu options ask for): https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/17012/how-to-find-your-ip-address-in-ubuntu/

Settings used were:

Wired connection 1 > IPv4 Settings
Method: Manual
Address: 192.168.200.183
Netmask: 24
Gateway: 192.168.200.2
DNS Servers: 192.168.200.2

1B) Keep default of automatic IP address, but look up the IP address assigned when you boot the VM.

Network icon in top right > Wired connection > Wired Settings > Wired "gearbox icon" > Details > IPv4 Address

Suppose it's 192.168.200.183

2) Start up webserver on Ubuntu.

$ cd flask_app
$ ./start_flash.sh

3) The server should start on localhost, with an address like https://0.0.0.0:5000/

On the host machine, substitute the VM's IPv4 address, keep the port, and *keep the https*.

Proceed past your browser's warning about invalid certificate (oops).

E.g. visit https://192.168.200.183:5000/

Project main page would then be at https://192.168.200.183:5000/static/canvas.html
