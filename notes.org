* Things layers need to do
** DONE Contain a reference to canvas
** DONE Contain a reference to context
** Support matrix operations on context (via monkey-patching):
*** DONE Set matrix (with context update)
*** DONE Transform with matrix
*** DONE Reset transform
*** DONE Get inverse transform
** Support drawing
*** For maximum flexibility, each layer has independent:
**** DONE last_draw
**** DONE last_transform
**** DONE redraw_on_transform_change
**** DONE temp_canvas
***** DONE clear_temp_canvas()
***** DONE reset_temp_canvas()
***** DONE get_temp_canvas()
*** DONE Has strokes & stroke_buckets
*** DONE Has transforms & transform_buckets
*** DONE Draw takes a layer as argument
