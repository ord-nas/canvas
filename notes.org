* Things layers need to do
** DONE Contain a reference to canvas
** DONE Contain a reference to context
** Support matrix operations on context (via monkey-patching):
*** DONE Set matrix (with context update)
*** DONE Transform with matrix
*** DONE Reset transform
*** DONE Get inverse transform
** Support drawing
*** For maximum flexibility, each layer has independent:
**** DONE last_draw
**** DONE last_transform
**** DONE redraw_on_transform_change
**** DONE temp_canvas
***** DONE clear_temp_canvas()
***** DONE reset_temp_canvas()
***** DONE get_temp_canvas()
*** DONE Has strokes & stroke_buckets
*** DONE Has transforms & transform_buckets
*** DONE Draw takes a layer as argument
* Multiple layers
** TODO Add layer stack
** TODO Draw all layers on tick
** TODO Figure out whether to set redraw_on_transform_change for all layers simultaneously
** Allow layers to be:
*** TODO Added
*** TODO Removed
*** TODO Reordered
* New tools
** TODO Eraser
** Line
*** TODO Free
*** TODO Snap to horizontal/vertical/45-degree(?)
** TODO Circle
** TODO Rectangle
** TODO Table?
** TODO Polygon?
** TODO Paintbucket
* Performance
** TODO Profile the drawing function (especially when it needs to redraw every frame)
** TODO Switch to using redraw_on_transform_change = false more often
*** Whenever a period of transformation begins / ends?
*** Always? Redraw in background, and use stale pictures in foreground?
**** DONE Investigate redrawing using Web Workers
***** Not available in Chrome yet! (https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=563816)
**** TODO Investigate interleaving of transforming stale & redrawing
* Refactoring
** TODO Refactor evalPeriod to take a function, apply it to each event
*** Use closures to support additional arguments
*** Transform events don't need to have an eval method, just expose the matrix
*** TODO Ensure this doesn't degrade performance
** TODO Try to fix the annoying hack in findTransformedPoint
