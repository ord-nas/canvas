* Things layers need to do
** Contain a reference to canvas
** Contain a reference to context
** Support matrix operations (currently monkey-patched onto context):
*** Set matrix (with context update)
*** Transform with matrix
*** Reset transform
*** Get inverse transform
** Support drawing
*** For maximum flexibility, each layer has independent:
**** last_draw
**** last_transform
**** redraw_on_transform_change
**** temp_canvas
*** Has strokes & stroke_buckets
*** Has transforms & transform_buckets
